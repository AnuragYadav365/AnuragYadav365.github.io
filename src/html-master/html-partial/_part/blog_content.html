  Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest
  planet in the Solar System after Mercury . In English, Mars carries
  a name of the Roman god of war , and is often referred to as the
  “Red Planet“ because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives
  it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical
  bodies visible to the naked eye.
</p>

<p>
  Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere , having surface
  features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the
  valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth .
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Like Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core
    overlaid by less dense materials.
  </li>
  <li>
    This iron(II) sulfide core is thought to be twice as rich in
    lighter elements as Earth’s.
  </li>
  <li>
    The core is surrounded by a silicate mantle that formed many of
    the tectonic and volcanic features on the planet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Elements in the Martian crust are iron, magnesium , aluminum ,
    calcium , and potassium .
  </li>
  <li>
    The average thickness of the planet’s crust is about 50 km (31
    mi).
  </li>
  <li>Earth’s crust averages 40 km (25 mi).<br /></li>

  Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient Greenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog
  in the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper, down in his close cabin; fog cruelly
  pinching the toes and fingers of his shivering little apprentice boy on deck. Chance people on the bridges
  peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog all round them, as if they were up in a balloon
  and hanging in the misty clouds.
